  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
     Traditional approaches to enhancing language models in dialogue systems
often involve complex modifications to tackle issues like sentence repetition and
incoherence. Our research introduces ’JudgerToken’, a streamlined solution that
utilizes a single additional token, integrated into the language model’s existing
vocabulary. This novel token is designed to score sentences generated by the model,
enabling the selection of outputs with the lowest repetition rates. By incorporating
this token, JudgerToken effectively reduces repetitive patterns, enhancing text clarity
and coherence without the need for architectural changes. Our results demonstrated
that this method not only maintains the simplicity of the language model, but also
significantly reduces repetition, thereby improving its overall performance.
